            To resolve a puzzle, you must fill <b>ALL</b> the cells with only two characters: <b>X</b> and <b>O</b>.
            <br />
            The rule is: <i>it can't have 4 identicals symbols horizontally, vertically or diagonally in a row.</i>
            <br />
            The application will notify you if applicable.
            <br />
            Each level has only <b>1 solution</b> and can be completed without guessing.
